    <p>Hi, I’m Ella Wallin, a Swedish concept artist with a love for nature. I specialize in environments, and I love creating spaces that feel alive, emotional and a little bit magical.<br><br>
    I recently graduated from the Animation Concept Art program at Vancouver Film School and I am currently available for freelance, internships or junior roles. I’m especially drawn to warm light, expressive colors, and scenes that spark a sense of wonder or nostalgia.<br><br>
    When I’m not painting, you’ll probably find me wandering around exploring the great outdoors, dancing to my favorite songs, or getting lost in fantasy books.<br><br>
    Thanks for stopping by!
